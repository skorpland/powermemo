title: Profile Validation
---

## Auto-Validate
By default, Powermemo will validate the new profile value before saving it.
By doing this, Powermemo can:
1. Make sure the extracted profile value is meaningful.
LLM may generate memories with very few information. For example, "User didn't speak his name", "User has work".
Validation in Powermemo can remove those meaningless memories.
2. Make sure the extracted profile is matched with your `description`([how to design profiles](/features/profile/profile_desc)).

But if you encounter some issues of missing profiles or the user profile is not big enough, maybe you can disable the validation by:
```yaml config.yaml
profile_validate_mode: false
```
Powermemo will save more possible profiles, but it may lead to some wrong/weird profiles.

## Strict Mode
We allow Powermemo to extend the current designed profile schema to include more important profiles.
For example, if you config is:
```yaml config.yaml
overwrite_user_profiles:
    - topic: "work"
      sub_topics:
        - "company"
```
Powermemo may have user profiles that look like:
```json Maybe Profile
"work": {
    "company": "Google",
    "position": "Software Engineer",
    "department": "Engineering",
    ...
}
```
In many cases, the additional profiles extended by AI are really helpful because you couldn't plan all the useful profiles for your users in advance.

But if you only want the profiles that you have designed in `config.yaml`, you can enable the strict mode by:
```yaml config.yaml
profile_strict_mode: true
```
Powermemo will strictly save the profiles in your `config.yaml`.
