title: Profile Slots

Powermemo allows you to customize the profile slots' creation and update.

## Instruct Powermemo to create a new profile slot
For easy understanding, Powermemo uses a `topic` and `sub_topics` to describe a profile slot.
For example
```yaml
overwrite_user_profiles:
    - topic: "work"
      sub_topics:
        - "company"
        - "position"
        - "department"
        - "start_date"
        - "achievements"
```

But sometimes the topic/sub-topic themselves are not enough for Powermemo to understand what you really want to track, 
you can add more description to them.

```yaml
overwrite_user_profiles:
    - topic: "work"
      sub_topics:
        ...
        - name: "start_date"
          description: "The start date of new job, in format YYYY-MM-DD"
```
`description` field is optional, and it will be used to help Powermemo to understand what you really want to track.


## Instruct Powermemo to update a profile slot
Powermemo not only creates those profiles, but also maintains them to be up-to-date.
That means, we need to update some of the slots when the user provides new information.

For example, if the user tells Powermemo that he/she has a new job, we need to update the `work/start_date` profile slot:
```
old_date -> "2020-01-01"
new_date -> "2021-01-01"

update_to -> "2021-01-01"
```

If you like a certain way of updating, you can add a `update_description` to the profile slot:

For example, if you like to keep the very first start date of the user's work history, you can add the following to your `config.yaml`:
```yaml
overwrite_user_profiles:
    - topic: "work"
      sub_topics:
        ...
        - name: "start_date"
          update_description: "Alway keep the oldest start date"
```
Powermemo will try not to update the `work/start_date` profile slot, and keep the oldest start date.
