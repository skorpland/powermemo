Powermemo is a [user profile](/features#user-profile-as-memory) backend for LLM Apps, that means it tracks the certain slots of user profile and updates them accordingly.

By default, Powermemo has a built-in user profile slots for general use cases.
But it allows you to customize the user profile to control the memory your App want to collect. 

### Locate the `config.yaml` file of self-hosted Powermemo
Powermemo uses a `config.yaml` file to configure the backend. 
Find your `config.yaml` file in `src/server/api/config.yaml`, normally it looks like this:

```yaml
max_chat_blob_buffer_token_size: 1024
buffer_flush_interval: 3600
llm_api_key: sk-...
best_llm_model: gpt-4o-mini
...

```
## Understand the user profile slots
By default, Powermemo has a built-in user profile slots, something like:
```markdown
- basic_info
    - name
    - gender
    ...
- education
    - school
    - major
    ...
```
If you like to add more slots, you can add them in the `additional_user_profiles` field in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
additional_user_profiles:
    - topic: "Gaming"
      description: "Track the gaming preferences/achievements of the user."
      sub_topics:
        - name: "FPS"
        description: "Games like CSGO, Valorant, etc."
        - "LOL"
    - topic: "Whatever"
      sub_topics:
        - "whatever 1"
        - "whatever 2"
```
Powermemo will track the additional slots and fill/update the user profile accordingly.  
Also, if you like to completely control the slots, you can use `overwrite_user_profiles` to place your own slots.
