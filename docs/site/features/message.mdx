title: Customize Chats
---

Powermemo remembers users by the chats you pass on, but sometime simple user/assistant messages will not enough:
- ‚ùì What if the message was happened before or in the future? You may want to import some messages or running your App in a future fantasy.
- ‚ùì What if the user/assistant has a name?

Powermemo allows you to pass additional fields to handle those cases

## Customize Any Timestamp for Your Chats
We first need to be clear about the two kind of timestamps in Powermemo:
- The "external" timestamp of memories: the time when the memory is stored/updated in our DB.
- The "interal" timestamp of memories:  Memory itself contains time-related information such as when events occurred, when travel plans were made, and birthdays, etc.

The "interal" timestamp usually the one you will care, because it will occur in the memories and therefore may affect the response of your AI.
By default, Powermemo assumes the insert time of the messages is the time the messages actually happen.

But you can customize this:
```python
from powermemo import PowermemoClient, ChatBlob
ÁîüÊó•
client = PowermemoClient(api_key="your_api_key")
u = client.get_user(client.add_user())

# The messages is happened in the future
m = ChatBlob(messages=[
    dict(role="user", content="I start a war", created_at="Year 32637")
])

u.insert(m)
```
By pass the date string in `created_at`, Powermemo will process this chats in your time. 
So the memory will be something like `User starts a way in year 32637`.

You can use any format of date in here, Powermemo will extract them at the appropriate granularity.
For example:
- `created_at="32637/1/1"`
- `created_at="32637-01-13"`
- `created_at="32637/23/19"`

They're both valid, and can be remembered.

## Make Alias for Characters
Sometimes the user/assistant relationship is more complicatedüòä.
They may have their own name:
```python
m = ChatBlob(messages=[
    dict(role="user", content="I want to start a war", alias="The Emperor"),
    dict(role="assistant", content="Please go to your bed", alias="The Mother")
])
```

By passing their names in `alias`, Powermemo will try to remember them with characters' name. 
So the memories may be `The Emperor wants to start a war The Mother disagrees`.
