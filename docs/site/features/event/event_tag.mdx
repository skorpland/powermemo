title: Event Tag
---

Event tag is a way to tag anything attributes of event automatically.
You can use event tag to enrich the user event, and doing some tracking on the user sequential behavior, something like:
- emotion
- goal
- romance
- ...

## How to set event tag?
By default, Powermemo will record no event tag. You need to set the event tag in your `config.yaml`:
```yaml
event_tags:
  - name: "emotion"
    description: "Record the current emotion of user"
  - name: "romance"
    description: "Record anything about romance between user and assistant"
...
```
where `name` is the name of the event tag, and `description` is the description of the event tag.

Once you set the event tag, Powermemo will record the event tag automatically and return events with event tags.
