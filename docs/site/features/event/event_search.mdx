Powermemo Event is a sequence of experiences and [tags](/features/event/event_tag) of user.
By default, their're ranked by time. But Powermemo offers a way to search events by query.

## Sementic Search
```python
# To use the Python SDK, install the package:
# pip install powermemo

from powermemo import Powermemo

client = Powermemo(project_url='PROJECT_URL', api_key='PROJECT_TOKEN')
uid = client.add_user()
u = client.get_user(uid)

events = u.search_event("Anything about my emotion")
print(events)
```
Powermemo will search events that the user talked about emotion, [tagged](/features/event/event_tag) with `emotion` or those which updated profiles with `emotion` slots.
