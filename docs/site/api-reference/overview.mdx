# Powermemo API Overview

Powermemo provides a powerful set of APIs for integrating user profile-based memory capabilities into your GenAI applications. Our APIs are designed to help your AI remember users through efficient memory management and profile generation.

## Key Features

- **User Memory Management**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete user memories with ease
- **Profile Generation**: Automatically generate user profiles from conversations and interactions
- **Buffer System**: Efficient memory processing with buffer zones for recent interactions
- **Customizable Profiles**: Define the aspects you want Powermemo to collect about your users
- **Secure Authentication**: API token-based access control for your data

## API Structure

Our API is organized into several main categories:

1. **User APIs**: Manage user entities and their data
   - Create and manage users
   - Update user information
   - Delete user accounts

2. **Data APIs**: Handle data operations
   - Insert blobs
   - Get blobs
   - Delete blobs
   - Get all blobs

3. **Profile APIs**: Access and manage user profiles
   - Get user profiles
   - Delete specific profiles
   - Customize profile generation

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using Bearer token authentication. Include your API token in the Authorization header of each request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## Getting Started

To begin using the Powermemo API, you'll need to:

1. Set up your Powermemo backend server
   - Default URL: `http://localhost:8019`
   - Default token: `secret`

2. Make your first API call:
   ```python
   from powermemo import PowerMemoClient
   
   mb = PowerMemoClient("http://localhost:8019", "secret")
   assert mb.ping()
   ```

3. Start exploring the APIs!


## Data Processing

By default, Powermemo processes and removes raw memory blobs after generating profiles. This ensures:
- Efficient storage usage
- Privacy-focused data handling
- Relevant information extraction

You can customize this behavior through configuration settings.
