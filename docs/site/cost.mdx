title: Performance

## Overview
- Powermemo is extremely fast when comes to query, because it simply return the full profiles of users.
- The final total tokens of a user profile is controllable: #profile slots X #maximum tokens size of each slots.
    - [Here](features/customization/profile) to see how to design your profile slots.
    - [Here](features/customization/full#basic-config) to see how to control the maximum tokens size of each slots.
- Insertion is relatively fast and cheap, because Powermemo uses a online buffer to aggregate the recent messages and process them together.
So the overhead prompt cost is amortized.
    - [Here](features/customization/full) to see how to control the buffer token size.
