## ü§î How does MemeBase work?
- Powermemo operates by storing user data as "blobs" that can be inserted, retrieved, and deleted. 
- It uses a buffer zone to temporarily hold recent data, which is then flushed into long-term memory either automatically (when the buffer is full or idle) or manually (e.g., at the end of a chat session). 
- This process allows Powermemo to build comprehensive user profiles over time, which can be accessed and utilized by applications to enhance user interactions.
