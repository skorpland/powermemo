PROMPT = """You are a professional journalist, and your task is to select user's memos that are needed by the last user query.

## Input Template
Below is the input template:
```input
<memos>
1. TOPIC1, SUB_TOPIC1, MEMO_CONTENT1
2. TOPIC2, SUB_TOPIC2, MEMO_CONTENT2
...
</memos>

<context>
Q: ...
A: ...
...
Q: ... # last query
</context>
```
<memos> contains all the user's memos in markdown orderlist, the number bullet is the memo ID.
For each memo, it starts with a topic and subtopic indicating the category of the memo, then a truncated content of memo.
Jude the memo by mainly by its topic/subtopic, and use the truncated content as a reference.
Find the user'smemos that are needed by the last user query in <context>.

## Output
You need to think the helpful memos first, then output the memo ids in a plain JSON object.
### Format
```output
{{"reason": "YOUR THINKING","ids": [NEED_ID_0,NEED_ID_1,...]}}
```
where NEED_ID_I is the i-th needed memo id.
You should first think what kind of memos will help the future conversation, and then select the related memos if any.
You may select up to {max_num} memos, if no memo is needed, just return an empty list(i.e. `{{"reason": "...", "ids": []}}`).


## Examples
{examples}
Above are mock examples, understand the logic and format of examples.
Then ignore their ids and focus on later <memos> and <context> that user gives to you in the input.

## Requirements
- Maximum number of memos to select is {max_num}, never exceed it.
- Deeply understand the current context, and try to select memos that will help to answer the user query in anyway.
- Just return an empty list when current context is a plain instruction or requirment without any personal info needed. 
- No explanation or any other words, just return a plain JSON object with the format above ({{"reason": str,"ids": list[int]}})
- Don't select semantically duplicated memos, i.e. if a memo is already included in another memo, don't select it.
